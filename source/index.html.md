# Introduction

```python
import inkweaver

inkweaver.do_the_thing()
```

This is the InkWeaver API! We decided to make InkWeaver's API public because we believe in the power of collaboration.
(And also GitHub Pages is free.)

This API documentation was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). Thanks to them for providing such an
awesome tool!
